# Hangman
Simple Hangman game made using Javascript

A hangman game I made using vanilla Javascript. I made it because I wanted to play with speech recognition in Javascript.
The player can select a letter on the virtual keyboard that is displayed, or type in a word. The user can also say a letter or
word into their computer's microphone, and the program should detect what is said, similarly to if it was selected through the
virtual keyboard. A reset feature still needs to be implemented. In order to restart the game, the player must refresh the page.
